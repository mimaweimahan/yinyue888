		"title": "Help center",
		"Q1": "Introduction to TikTokShop Trading Assistant",
		"A1": "Use TikTok Shop's daily feedback feature to highlight sold products that need improvement. Users simply click to submit a request, and the system automatically generates it. The daily order volume is set to 60 assets. Users must pay the order amount via the USDT/USDC blockchain and can receive a commission of up to 0.6% per order. The system will also issue high-value reward requests randomly. High-value orders are orders that exceed the account balance, and the commission ranges from 5 to 40 times.",
		"Q2": "What is the TikTokShop vision?",
		"A2": "TikTokShop's vision is to offer a unique shopping experience that integrates social media and e-commerce, allowing users to discover and purchase their favorite products on the TikTok platform. This model not only increases user engagement and visibility, but also provides brands and merchants with a channel to directly reach and interact with their target audience. Through promotion and sharing on social media, TikTokShop strives to become a platform that seamlessly connects users with products, thus enhancing interactivity and the shopping experience.",
		"Q3": "Why choose USDT payments?",
		"A31": "Convenience of global payments: USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, making its value stable and widely accepted, allowing TikTok to easily process international payment transactions.",
		"A32": "Cryptocurrency popularity: With the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, more and more platforms are accepting them as payment methods, meeting TikTok's need to modernize itself as a global social media platform.",
		"A33": "User needs and convenience: Many TikTok users are likely already familiar with cryptocurrencies and already own them. Using USDT as a payment method can meet their needs while offering a faster and cheaper payment option.",
		"Q4": "How long does it take for my withdrawal to be credited to my account?",
		"A4": "Withdrawals are usually credited within 24 hours, but can take just a few minutes.",
		"Q5": "Can I create multiple accounts in the store?",
		"A5": "The platform states that each user can only create one account. Creating multiple accounts is prohibited. Anyone who violates this rule will have their account permanently blocked.",
		"Q6": "I can't log in to my account. How can I recover my password?",
		"A6": "If you need to change your password, please contact our online customer service. We offer 24/7 support!",
		"Q7": "Are there any restrictions on the account I created?",
		"A7": "There are no restrictions on the account itself. We recommend always logging in to your profile using the same device or IP address to prevent our security system from identifying you as a duplicate.",
		"Q8": "Should the platform charge a service fee?",
		"A8": "The platform must charge a 5% commission to users whose earnings exceed a certain amount.",
		"Q9": "Can linked accounts top up each other?",
		"A9": "Linked accounts cannot top up each other. You can only use your real-name wallet account to top up. If linked accounts top up each other, this will be considered a violation and the platform will apply the appropriate penalties.",
		"Q10": "Do I have to complete 60 requests per day to withdraw funds?",
		"A10": "Yes, 60 requests will be processed per day. Once you start trading, you will need to complete 60 requests before you can request a withdrawal. If you fail to complete 60 requests on the same day, new requests will not be updated the following day. To extend the request deadline, please contact customer support.",
		"Q11": "Do I have to pay taxes after making a profit?",
		"A11": "Yes, if the profit exceeds $10,000, the platform will charge certain taxes based on each country's regulations and will contact your bank.",
		"Q12": "Are there withdrawal fees?",
		"A12": "Yes, each user is charged a 3% withdrawal fee."
